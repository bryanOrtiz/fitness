# fitness

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate understanding of how SwiftUI and Combine work together to create a modern iOS experience. 

Currently, the backend API is solely depending on the [Workout Manager Project](https://github.com/wger-project/wger). 

With the help of the Workout Manager Project, this app demonstrates the basic features needed in a modern fitness application:

1. Looking up Exercises
2. Creating Workouts
3. Scheduling Workouts
4. Creating Nutrition plans
5. Looking up ingredients

and so much more.
